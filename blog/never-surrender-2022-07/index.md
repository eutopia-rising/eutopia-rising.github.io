NEVER SURRENDER is a recurring party that has taken several forms over several years, both live and virtual, before going on an extended hiatus some time ago. But it was never gone, never forgotten. Now, we return to life, and to a live event, with the same good vibes we’ve always had.
We are a place to play, to feel safe, and to reconnect. We are a chill space for good times with good people. We are a party and a protest, a ritual and a revel. We are a circle of love spitting naked defiance at a world in crisis.

We are returning to our newly found downtown venue. After the success of our event in April we are expanding the available party space – more space for coats, more space for chill-out, more space for play.

Make loud noises. Leave lipstick traces. Make memories. Talk, play, show off, or just be a witness to the magic. Come as whatever gender you are, wear whatever makes you happy.
Bring your technicolor self along and turn up the heat on a summer night in the city.
