We host many of our sexy events and workshops at secret venues and private homes. In an attempt to create a safer and more comfortable space for all of our guests, it's our policy to gather some basic information about our attendees.

We call the people who we have accepted into our trusted community our **Voyagers**.

As an approved Voyager, you'll receive invitations to Eutopia Rising's private, vetted events. Before we invite you to travel along with us, we'd like to know a little bit more about who you are and what you like to do.

**Lunar Events** are adults-only parties and late night sexy fun. We carefully curate our guest list in the interests of greater safety and accountability. Like everything we do, enthusiastic consent is the golden rule. We also host **Solar Events** which are open to the wider community.

**Your personal information will be kept strictly confidential and will only ever be visible to the triumvirate vetting team of the Eutopia Rising crew.**
