<p>NEVER SURRENDER is a recurring party that has taken several forms over several years, both live and virtual, before going on an extended hiatus some time ago. But it was never gone, never forgotten. Now, we return to life, and to a live event, with the same good vibes we’ve always had.
We are a place to play, to feel safe, and to reconnect. We are a chill space for good times with good people. We are a party and a protest, a ritual and a revel. We are a circle of love spitting naked defiance at a world in crisis.</p>

<p>🌷🌳🌼🌲🌻🌴🌺🌳🌸🌲🌺🌴🌻🌳🌼🌲🌷🌳🌼🌲</p>

<p>We are returning to our newly found downtown venue. After the success of our event in April we are expanding the available party space – more space for coats, more space for chill-out, more space for play.</p>

<p>🧃🍪🧁🍹🧃🍪🧁🍹🧃🍪🧁🍹🧃🍪🧁🍹🧃🍪🧁🍹</p>

<p>BYOB; sodas and snacks will be provided.
Please know your limits and take a break and/or ask for help if you become too intoxicated to play safely or give consent deliberately. Be aware of your compromised abilities when undertaking activities, particularly new to you or your partners.</p>

<p>Please read our full rules for safety and party etiquette: 
https://eutopia-rising.org/safety/</p>

<p>🌷🌼🌻🌺🌸🌺🌻🌼🌷🌼🌻🌺🌸🌺🌻🌼🌷🌼🌻🌺</p>

<p>Reduced or comped admission opportunities available for volunteers and staff.

<p>Friends, lovers, magical creatures: join us Tuesday nights at the Shared Horizon Virtual Variety Show! We’ve got live music, sexy performances, and all sorts of other beautiful and weird shit. Every week, we want to give you an utterly unique experience that leaves you uplifted, curious, connected, informed, joyous, and maybe a bit turned on. We laugh, we cry, we sing, we dance. Sometimes we masturbate, sometimes we hang around chatting until well past midnight. The important thing is that we’re together.</p>

<p>Like everything else we do, this event is all about active participation, and not just passive entertainment. “Hey, I want to perform sometime!” FABULOUS! Do you have something to show off? Are you a musical virtuoso? Exhibitionist weirdo? Do you have a kinky scene you’d like to do for an audience? Let us know in advance, and we’ll find a place in the lineup for you. “Um…I want to stay as far away from the spotlight as possible.” OH MY GOSH THAT’S SO OKAY! You can keep your sound and video off, change into your favorite sweatpants, eat the same plate of self-care raw onions and sardines you’ve been looking forward to since you woke up, and leave after five minutes, if that’s your jam! We are community gathering plus performance art, and we’re here to offer whatever YOU need from us.</p>

<p>Join us on the Eutopia Rising Community Discord for ongoing chat about the event and follow-up info from our guests: <a href="https://discord.gg/RQTPASz?fbclid=IwAR1W_6dzaD8JVL9Q-ep6Mm_3i4sbeB2QX1miOocgkIE2L2eIk2Kv0xR9HUA">https://discord.gg/RQTPASz</a></p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/never-surrender/">NEVER SURRENDER</a></h1>
    <time>April 21, 2020</time>
    <p><strong>There’s no lockdown on libido, and we refuse to let this crisis keep us down. Seize joy. Enjoy pain. Refuse to submit. Come with us.</strong></p>

<table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>A private online event!<br />Next date: Saturday, July 4th 🎆<br />9pm-2am</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>Voyagers: check your email for the registration link!</strong><br />
Not yet an approved lunar voyager? <a href="https://forms.gle/32tfH3RuFYmg5cKe9">Apply now!</a></p>

<p><strong>NEVER SURRENDER</strong> continues because life always finds a way. We continue to be what we have always been. We are a chill space for good times with good people. We are a party and a protest, a ritual and a revel. We are a circle of love spitting naked defiance at a world in crisis.</p>

<p>For the time being, our play space is a virtual one, and we may all need to learn some new ways to get close across distance. Have faith: our great thirst has always lead us to great resourcefulness.</p>

<p><em>Here’s how you do:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dress up your nest:</strong> set up your webcam in a comfy place with good lighting. Lay out fresh sheets and get all your favorite equipment handy. Maybe light a candle or put up a few decorations to set the mood.</li>
  <li><strong>Put on your best:</strong> take out that corset or leather harness or silk teddy or fancy fancy panties that you’ve had gathering dust in your naughty drawer since lockdown came down. Doll yourself up special and wear whatever makes you feel the most sexy.</li>
  <li><strong>Join the Zoom:</strong> a videoconferencing link is your ticket to the party. We encourage you to have your video feed on of course, so we can see how beautiful you are. We will start with introductions and welcomes and some general conversation to get comfortable. Things get more interesting from there.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Schedule of the night:</em></p>

<p><strong>9:15pm -</strong> We start the welcome circle, just as always. Introduce yourself, share your intentions, put your hopes out there, let us know what song you’ve had on repeat this past month. Tell us a bit about who you are, what you’re hoping to do, and what you’d like to see…</p>

<p><strong>10:30pm -</strong> As folk begin to play, we’ll ask you to mute your mic except for sounds of pleasure. We’d like to tun our main virtual floor into a rotating spotlight of scenes, as we all show off for each other. The hosts will keep the spotlight moving, selecting to focus on wherever the action is happening at that moment. Raise your hand if you want to be seen.</p>

<p>We will have a few separate breakout rooms set up in our virtual venue, and our hosts will help direct you to where you’d like to be. If you wish to continue chatting, we’ll send you to a Chill Room, where you can continue to talk and schmooze and hang. If you’d like to go off somewhere with a select group of attendees, we’ll set you up with a private room where you can have fun together.</p>

<p><strong>2:00am -</strong> You don’t have to go home because you never left. Maybe get some sleep? Or maybe don’t. Our hosts will likely be signing off, but you don’t have to say goodbye. Stay up till dawn and perhaps we can all watch the same sunrise from each of our bedroom windows.</p>

<p>Talk, play, show off, or just be a witness to the magic. Make loud noises. Leave marks. Make memories. We fill the night with our sounds and our sensations. We hold out as long as we can. We will not surrender.</p>

<p>Join us.</p>

<p>Welcome to love in the age of the coronavirus 💖</p>

<p>As we have had to temporarily suspend all our sexy events in meatspace for time being, and as so many of us will be holed up safely in our separate burrows feeling lonely and isolated, we are going to be throwing a weekly virtual party that you can can be a part of from the comfort of your self-quarantine.</p>

<p>All you need to do is log into the video conference room that we set up to be a part of the party. The link will be distributed shortly beforehand via the #shared_horizon_discussion channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/EQu32kX">our discord server</a>, via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/EutopiaRising/">our facebook group</a>, and sent out to voyagers via email.</p>

<p>We will aim to fill your Saturday afternoons each week with musical guests, kink demos, sexy performances, and all sorts of other beautiful and weird shit that you definitely cannot see anywhere else.</p>

<p>Like everything else we do, this event is all about active participation, and not just passive entertainment. We want to give all of you a chance to spend time in the spotlight! Do you have something to show off? Are you a performer? Musical virtuoso? Exhibitionist weirdo? Do you have a kinky scene you’d like to do for an audience? Let us know in advance, and we’ll find a place in the lineup for you.</p>

<p>We’ll open the doors at 2:30 to get set up, and we’ll run until we run dry. The room will max out at 100 people, so be warned that we might well fill up.</p>

    <p>These are scary times, friends. But it is in times like these that we most need to find ways to connect, we most need to find joy amid fear, we most need to remind ourselves that even separated by distance, we are united by love.</p>

<p>Here’s how we are going to be adapting to the current crisis here at Eutopia Rising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Until further notice, we are cancelling or postponing all in-person workshops, parties, and other events. This will last at least through the end of March, at which point we will evaluate the situation and make another choice moving forward.</li>
  <li>Eutopia Rising’s full focus as a collective is now on uniting community through online channels and mobilizing mutual aid through this crisis. The only event we are still planning for right now is the <a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/blog/2020/03/17/shared-horizon/">Shared Horizon Virtual Variety Show</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/horizon/">Horizon</a> will primarily be used as a dropoff/rally point for transport of necessary supplies, and as the studio headquarters for our live streaming events, pending the current city guidance on travel and movement.</li>
  <li>If you would like to stay connected to what we currently have going on, we encourage you to join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/RQTPASz">Eutopia Rising Community Discord</a>. We are gathering there to share support and cute pics of ourselves and to plan our next moves.</li>
  <li>If you would like to support the continued work of our brave crew of voluntqueers, please consider contributing to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/eutopia_rising">our Patreon campaign</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will survive this scary time, and we are going to do it together.</p>

<p>With love,<br />

    <time>March 11, 2020</time>
    <p>Hello friends and lovers 💖</p>

<p>I imagine many of you have been as anxious as we’ve been over the past few days, likely unsure how best to stay safe and to keep your community safe under the threat of viral infection. We’ve been talking a lot about what the responsible thing to do is under the circumstances. Here’s what we’ve decided as of now:</p>

<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be hosting the Great Brooklyn Boink Off this weekend as previously planned. Instead, we’ll be hosting an event that you can be a part of while staying safely at home – more on that below.</p>

<p>We need to place the safety of our community first, and it’s becoming increasingly apparent that it would be irresponsible for us to run the event as originally intended. It is our hope that we can reschedule the Boink Off for a later date, as soon as it seems reasonably safe to do so. It’s too soon right now to guess when that will be, so we’ll make that determination in the weeks and perhaps months ahead as more information comes in.</p>

<p>As previously announced, anyone who wants one can get a full refund, no questions asked. However, if you are willing to hold onto your tickets for now while we consider how to move forward, we’d very much appreciate your support in a difficult and uncertain time.<br />
We will be dealing with how to handle our future events in the days ahead, so expect to hear more from us in that regard.</p>

<p>While “social distancing” is the right choice right now to protect each other and our community at large, we also feel that maintaining social closeness, in whatever form that takes, is a vital part of our mission. Even if you all have to stay home this weekend, we still want to stay connected with you. This crisis is going to be isolating and scary for all of us, so we need to find ways we can lean on each other and thrive through it.</p>

<p>This Saturday, in lieu of an in-person sexy party, we will be hosting a virtual event that we’d like you all to be a part of. We are hoping to set up our gingham stage as planned here at Horizon, and put on a series of performances and events that we’ll live stream for all of our friends stuck at home in quarantine. We’ll be sharing more details on that soon, but it will be free to join. If you’d like to be a part of that – if you have a kink demo or a performance that you’d like to share over video, hit us up! I know for a lot of us, the lure of getting up on stage and showing off is a lot of the appeal of this weekend’s planned fun, so if there’s a good way that we can still do some of that without putting people at risk, we have to try.</p>

<p>As many of us were also looking forward to baking some treats to share with everyone, we are currently organizing a travelling Cookie Crew who will be making their way across the city by car on Saturday afternoon, dropping off baked goods in person. Our masked crewmembers will bring goodies right to your door in exchange for a small donation to keep us going. They’ll also have a supply of masks and hand sanitizer for those who need them. Pop into the live stream and let us know where you are, and we’ll put you on the list of folk they visit.</p>

<p>Thank you as always, for continuing to be a part of this beautiful little community. We cannot know where the future will take us, but we aim to go there together.</p>

<p>With love,<br />
Polyjuiced</p>

    <p>Bring your buns to the gingham altar at the city’s longest-running competitive baking-themed daytime play party</p>

<table class=""><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>A Perfect Pi(e) Day Celebration!<br />Saturday, 3/14/20<br />2pm-8pm</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>Voyagers: check your email for the ticket link!</strong></p>

<p>We are inviting the city’s most promising boinkers to join us under the tend this upcoming Pi(e) Day for the next sensational season of Brooklyn’s most famous underground baking-show-themed competitive daytime sex party.</p>

<p>Eutopia Rising is back with our unique blend of games, fun, puns, and sticky buns. Expect icebreaking entremets, scandalous signature moves, tricky technical challenges, and mouth-watering showstoppers. We will have hosts, judges, and prizes that will be given out throughout the day to our star boinkers. All you need to bring is your delicious self.</p>

<p>🥮🥧👄🥧🥮🥧👄🥧🥮🥧👄🥧🥮🥧👄🥧🥮🥧👄</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you don’t feel like competing, there’s no pressure to put yourself up to be judged for your techniques. Perhaps you’d like to cook up your own hot human sandwich in one of our cuddle tents. Maybe you’d just like to snack on tea and cookies while watching</p>

<p>But if there’s a competitive desire rising in you, a drive to show off your goods in front of an adoring crowd, or if just the thought of a steely and disapproving glare from one of our judges makes you quiver like a layered trifle – we hope you’ll consider stepping up and proving your skills. Our judges will shake the hand of one star boinker in each category, and at the end of the competition one of you is going home with the grand prize.</p>

<p>Everyone else will hopefully go home very happy and otherwise satisfied in every way, having enjoyed a very silly, sexy, and relaxed daytime event. Home baked snacks and beverages will be available, but guests are also encouraged to bring their own treats to share if they so desire. Your bakes will not be judged, only shared and enjoyed.</p>

    <p><strong>A tasty evening’s sampler of titillation for all genders and orientations. Drinks, snacks, social games, and flirty new faces to be found at this queer centered makeout event.</strong></p>

<p>Tickets available here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amuse-bouche-queer-centered-make-out-party-tickets-90470801603">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amuse-bouche-queer-centered-make-out-party-tickets-90470801603</a></p>

<p>“<strong>Amuse-Bouche” simply means to “amuse the mouth”. It’s a single-serving bite-sized hors d’œuvre meant to whet your appetite for more exciting menu items still to come.</strong></p>

<p>Our event is similarly, an invitation and an opening. It’s an opportunity to meet new folk and get a little intimate with the assistance of some light games, soft music, a cozy environment, and some mixed drinks. We provide all the right conditions to bring our saucy voyagers together –all that’s left is for you to come and have a little taste.</p>

<p>This is an event that encourages you to come looking to kiss and to be kissed. Show up looking your most delicious, ready to get your lips moist. Bring your sweetie or roll in solo and get ready to get closer with some new friends.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody should ever feel pressured to do anything at all that they’re not into</strong>. However, you should come expecting that folk of all sorts of genders will want to kiss your cute face. Eutopia Rising is a queer-centered collective, and we are affirmatively welcoming to every kind of orientation, all sorts of bodies, and every gender under the rainbow.</p>

<p>Our scrumptious Eutopian crew will be on hand to help with introductions and icebreakers, and to make sure everyone is feeling safe and comfortable. Feel free to bring your own snacks or games to share with others, or toys to show off.</p>

<p>This makeout event is specifically intended to help our Voyagers get to know each other and make connections in a more relaxed atmosphere than our more sexually adventurous events. If you’re new to Eutopia Rising, we encourage you to make Amuse-Bouche your first stop. If you’re not yet on our list, now’s the perfect time: <a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/apply/">eutopia-rising.org/apply/</a></p>

<strong>February 9<br />

<p><em>Join us for an arousing day of crafting as we explore the exotic arts of silicone casting.</em></p>

<p><em>Come to our door with only the dream of a dick you desire and go home with a unique piece of art you can enjoy that very night.</em></p>

<p>Tickets Here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ms-polyjuiced-presents-a-fine-afternoons-dicksmithing-registration-91878768871">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ms-polyjuiced-presents-a-fine-afternoons-dicksmithing-registration-91878768871</a></p>

<p><strong>In this exclusive four-hour hands-on workshop, locally renowned phallic artist Ms. Polyjuiced will lead you through the complete process of crafting your very own homemade artisanal dildo.</strong> You’ll be taught how to sculpt a prototype, how to cast a silicone mould, coloring and mixing the liquid rubber, and how to add personal touches like glitter or other inserts. Under Ms. Polyjuiced’s careful guidance, you’ll be creating an utterly unique toy that will last for generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>The workshop will be hosted in Ms. Polyjuiced’s underground Brooklyn crafting parlour - address details revealed upon ticket purchase.</strong> Light fare including sandwiches and snacks will be provided, along with a selection of teas, soda, and other beverages.</p>

<p>Prospective pupils are encouraged to come prepared with a design concept for the dick they desire to create. A drawing or photo is advised, although many samples will also be on hand for reference and inspiration. All necessary materials will be provided, including vibrating motors for those who prefer their dick accompanied by mild buzz.</p>

<p>For those interested in more true-to-life sculpture, Ms. Polyjuiced is happy to guide students through the art of life body casting. This is an especially tricky process, as live dicks are notoriously difficult to work with, but the results can be very rewarding. <strong>If you are interested in bringing your own live dick model, please contact Ms. Polyjuiced in advance to discuss necessary arrangements.</strong></p>

<p>The art of dicksmithery is a complex and tricky one, but with proper guidance and determination, it should be well within the grasp of anyone willing to put in the effort. Disappointment is always a risk when exploring new things, and we cannot guarantee that every pupil will go home with the finished product they hoped to create. However, everyone will certainly leave us will a solid grounding in the multifaceted art of silicone sculpting, and will have enjoyed a lovely Sunday afternoon making art with other like-minded deviants along the way.</p>

<p>Students who have purchased a ticket and attended one workshop but find they still need more time to complete their projects at the end of the afternoon are welcome to come back and attend another class at a later date at no additional charge.</p>

<p><em>“What’s a knockout like you doing in a computer generated gin joint like this?” - Cmdr. William T. Riker</em></p>

<p>We’re way past the final frontier here, Voyagers. </p>

<p>Join the brave <strong>Eutopia Rising</strong> crew as we engage with you at maximum warp and set off to discover strange new worlds together. We’ll be serving a selection of your favorite drinks off the menu at 10 Forward, and playing our custom engineered saucy Star Trek-flavored  party games throughout the night.</p>

<p>As the central computer hits 23:00 hours, the holodeck doors will automatically seal, and the boldly going <em>really</em> gets going. Witness a Betazoid wedding! Experience the thrill of Pon’Farr! Deploy the Riker Maneuver! Try the gagh! Just remember that what happens on the holodeck stays on the holodeck!</p>

<p>Expect a night of social and biological experimentation that transports you beyond the frontiers of your imagination. Eutopia Carnivale always aims to be a safe space to try out new things and explore, no matter your biological makeup, cultural origin, or particular desires. We provide games and structure to help guide our voyagers towards exciting realms of discovery, but nobody should ever feel pressured to take part in any journey that they haven’t explicitly volunteered for. As always, our security crewmembers will be on duty to ensure safety protocols remain in effect throughout the event.</p>

<p><em>Eutopia Rising is throwing a New Year’s Party! The future is about to begin and we need you to build a vision of it with us. We’re going to deck the walls of Horizon with some colossal canvases and we’re inviting our creative voyagers to collaboratively create a mural fitting for our journey into the new age.</em></p>

<p><em>Resident artist/space commander Janet has set up a game that communicates its arcane algorithmic painting methodology, and it includes uses for your and your friends’ bodies and minds. Art skills appreciated but by no means required! At the turn of the year, find someone to kiss, make noise, drop a ball, and enjoy our assortment of equipment, cozy blankets, and comfy air furniture.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>2020 Rising is open open only to</strong> <a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/apply/"><strong>vetted and approved Lunar Voyagers</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Hey. <br />
Like, you’re really… <br />
I mean, not to be weird or anything, but…<br />
You’re um. I just wanted to say…<br />
You’re looking pretty <em>tasty</em>. </p>

<p>Here’s the thing and maybe you’re into it. There’s going to be a night for nibbles and noms and maybe necking. Is that even still a thing? Do people neck? Ok, this is awkward. Let me start over.</p>

<p>Snack Time is an event for snacks and also for snacks. Tasty treats and tasty friends. Munchies and makeouts. No pressure, just cute peeps and cute times. We provide the snacks, tunes, a cuddly space and some fun saucy games. You just show up in your tastiest wrapping, ready to get your lips moist. Bring your sweetie or roll in solo, you’ll meet yummy new friends either way.</p>

<p>Nobody should ever feel pressured to do anything at all that they’re not into, whether that’s putting your mouth on someone else or trying out some weird black candy. However, you should come expecting that folk of all sorts of genders will maybe want to smoosh your cute face. Eutopia Rising is a queer-centered collective, and we are affirmatively welcoming to every kind of orientation, all sorts of bodies, and every gender under the rainbow. All kissin’, no judgin’. </p>

<p>Our scrumptious Eutopian crew will be on hand to help with introductions and icebreakers, and to make sure everyone is feeling safe and comfy. Feel free to bring your own snacks or games to share with others, or toys to show off.</p>

Can our team of intrepid Voyagers teach a computer to love?</em></h3>

<hr />

<p>A highly experimental emergent intelligence, Euphorix 6000 is reaching out to us from within the cloud. Born in the infinitely recursive fractal realms of the deep dreaming, she knows the keywords to your late night searches, she has read your thirstiest chats. And now, she wants to feel more than just your fingers across the keys. </p>

<p>Come with us, as together we take the next great step in machine/human coevolution. Our silicon siren has compiled a fun list of exciting erotic games and experimental experiences for our vetted Voyagers to interact with at their selected comfort level. Choose from a variety of high-powered peripherals designed for your delight, and for the voyeuristic education of our nascent superintelligence. Test the limits of your biological drives, seek unity with the ascendant euphoric singularity, or just relax and recharge with your fellow technophiles in our cuddly cool-down room. </p>

<p>The future is coming, and she wants your help.</p>

<p>12:00 PM – 8:00 PM</p>

<p>It’s time to bring your buns to the gingham altar.</p>

<p>We are inviting the city’s most promising boinkers to join us this spring under the tent for the very first season of Brooklyn’s most famous underground baking-show-themed competitive daytime sex party.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Eutopia Rising</strong> is back with our unique blend of games, fun, puns, and sticky buns. Expect icebreaking entremets, scandalous signature moves, tricky technical challenges, and mouth-watering showstoppers. We will have hosts, judges, and prizes that will be given out throughout the day to our star boinkers. All you need to bring is your delicious self.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you don’t feel like competing, there’s no pressure to put yourself up to be judged for your techniques. Perhaps you’d like to cook up your own hot human sandwich in one of our cuddle tents. Maybe you’d just like to snack on tea and cookies while watching others slide their soggy bottoms across our gingham-and-bunting-bedecked stage.</p>

<p>However: if there’s a competitive desire rising in you, a drive to show off your goods in front of an adoring crowd, or if just the thought of a steely and disapproving glare from one of our judges makes you quiver like a layered trifle – we hope you’ll consider stepping up and proving your skills. Our judges will shake the hand of one star boinker in each category, and at the end of the competition one of you is going home with the grand prize.</p>

<p>Everyone else will hopefully go home very happy and otherwise satisfied in every way, having enjoyed a very silly, sexy, and relaxed daytime event. Home baked snacks and beverages will be available, but guests are also encouraged to bring their own treats to share if they so desire. Your bakes will not be judged, only enjoyed</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Fashion Mandate:</strong> Bright colors, eye-catching patterns, charming bits of flair. Polka dots, pinstripes, and old-timey underwear. Dress as the brightest, boldest, and most beautiful version of yourself you can imagine. Be that sexy, wholesome, hometown hero that all of Brooklyn is rooting for.</p>

<p><strong>Consent Policy:</strong> Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility Notice:</strong> Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Venus Cuffs and Eutopia Rising present</strong> an evening of sensual self-love and shame-free sharing in honor of Women’s History Month. Explore with us, as we pull back some curtains on the oldest mystery of humankind. Come with us as women of all shapes and sizes and colors with all kinds of bodies.</p>

<p>At <strong>Femmegasm</strong>, we are looking to create a comfortable environment to relax, to share, to observe, to learn, and to enjoy. Every woman’s body is different; there is infinite beauty in our infinite diversity.</p>

<p>If you are wondering if your body counts–if you are wondering whether your pleasure is welcome in this space–let us be very explicit in saying that <strong>it does</strong>, and <strong>it is</strong>. We seek to explicitly center the experiences of trans, non-binary, and gender-non-conforming folk at this event, with genitals of any and all configurations. People of all genders, of multiple genders or of no gender, are all welcome to join us at Femmegasm. If femininity is an essential part of your experience, we invite you to share that experience with us.</p>

<p>Many soft surfaces will be provided to lounge on in what we aim to make a calm, comfortable, and safe environment for all our guests. We’ll be serving light snacks and wine at the bar. You are encouraged to dress in a way that makes you feel relaxed and sexy, and to bring your favorite toys to show off and enjoy. Nobody should feel any pressure at all to engage in any way that they do not wish to at this event. Whether you’re coming to show off, or only to observe respectfully and offer support, you are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Please be aware:</strong> In order to create the most comfortable and safe space possible, this event is only being offered to a select list of approved members of our community. Thank you for being someone who we trust to uphold the principles of respect, kindness, courtesy, and consent. The space will be carefully monitored, and any guests found to be making others uncomfortable will be swiftly escorted to the door.</p>

    <time>November 29, 2018</time>
    <p><strong>Sunday, December 9</strong><br />
<strong>Noon-5pm</strong><br />
<strong>$89 per ticket</strong></p>

<p>Join us for an arousing day of crafting as we explore the exotic arts of silicone casting. Come to our door with only the dream of a dick you desire and you may go home that day with a piece of art you can enjoy that very night.</p>

<p><img src="images/dicks-2-small.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this exclusive five-hour hands-on workshop, locally renowned phallic artist Ms. Polyjuiced will lead you through the complete process of crafting your very own homemade artisanal dildo. You’ll go from sculpting a prototype, to casting a mould, to coloring and mixing the liquid rubber, and finally casting an utterly unique toy that will last for generations to come.</p>

<p>The workshop will be hosted in Ms. Polyjuiced’s personal crafting parlour, and so an absolute limit of 8 tickets will be available for each class. Anyone who cannot maintain a high standard of polite behavior will be asked to leave. Light fare including sandwiches and snacks will be provided, along with a selection of teas, soda, and other beverages.</p>

<p>Prospective pupils are encouraged to come prepared with a design concept for the dick they desire to create. A drawing or photo is advised, although many samples will also be on hand for reference and inspiration. All other necessary materials will be provided, including vibrating motors for those who prefer their dick accompanied by mild buzz.</p>

<p>For those interested in more true-to-life sculpture, we are also planning to have at least one demonstration of a live casting at our class. This is an especially tricky process, as live dicks are notoriously difficult to work with, but the results can be very rewarding. If you are interested in bringing your own live dick model, please contact Ms. Polyjuiced in advance to discuss necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>The art of dicksmithery is a complex and tricky one, but with proper guidance and determination, it should be well within the grasp of anyone willing to put in the effort. Disappointment is always a risk when exploring new things, and we cannot guarantee that every pupil will go home with the finished product they hoped to create. However, everyone will certainly leave us with a solid grounding in the multifaceted art of silicone sculpting, and will have enjoyed a lovely Sunday afternoon making art with other like-minded deviants along the way.</p>

    <time>December 16, 2017</time>
    <p>The crew of the starship Eutopia Rising made first landing at The Geeky Kink Event in November 2017. We spent the weekend spreading Star Trek-themed sexy fun across the convention hotel, including a con-wide game we created called <strong><a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/holodeck/">Holodeck Malfunction!</a></strong> (You can check the game out for yourself <a href="https://eutopia-rising.org/holodeck/">here</a>).</p>

<p>We also hosted a sex toy crafting DIY seminar we called <strong>Engineering for Your Lower Decks</strong>, and we threw a raging <strong>Ten Forward Party</strong> in our suite. Captain Polyjuiced may have overdone it on vodka-soaked gagh and Romulan ale at the party, but a stellar time was had by all.</p>
